### [Investors shouldn't 'reach too far for risk': Strategist While contending
with September's seasonal volatility, stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) slide
further in Friday's session in response to the August jobs data released this
morning. While nonfarm payroll jobs growth came below economist expectations,
the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2%. All of these factors are colliding
with losses seen in the AI chip trade as semiconductor manufacturers Nvidia
(NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) failed to wow Wall Street with their earnings
beats. John Hancock Investment Management co-chief investment strategist Emily
Roland sits down with the Market Domination team to discuss which sectors
investors can find more quality trades in while avoiding risk. "The poster
child for quality is mega-cap tech. We like that, but we do have a valuation
issue there with the tech sector bumping up towards 30-times forward
earnings," Roland explains. "So we want to look at other areas of the market
quality at a reasonable price, if you will. So looking at sectors like
healthcare, which are trading at a 10% discount to the broad market..." Roland
weighs in on Big Tech stocks, the AI trade, and the bond market (^TYX, ^TNX,
^FVX) ahead of the Federal Reserve's plans to cut interest rates. For more

### [It's 'premature' to think soft landing is secured: Strategist Investors
are moving to defensive corners of the market (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) on Thursday
as fresh data sparked some concerns of too much weakness in the labor market.
SoFi head of investment strategy Liz Young Thomas joins Morning Brief to
discuss the market's reaction to the data and how investors can best position
their portfolios as the Federal Reserve begins its rate-easing cycle. Thomas
notes that "equities are still cheering for the beginning of this rate-cutting
cycle" as the Fed eyes a soft landing. She explains that easing rates will
likely benefit cyclical areas of the market, like small caps (^RUT),
financials (XLF), real estate (XLRE), and industrials (XLI). However, she
warns that "it would be premature to assume that we have secured a soft
landing." Investors should still have some exposure to areas of the market
that benefit from a steepening yield curve. Thomas points to gold (GC=F) as a
good option as the global currency is experiencing volatility. As all eyes are
on Friday's August jobs report, Thomas believes that if the data comes in
cooler than expected, the market will react negatively and will likely
experience a sell-off of mega-cap names. She adds that utilities are "not just
a purely defensive play" at this stage, as they are a beneficiary of the AI
trade. In addition, she explains that consumer staples (XLP) — another
traditional defensive play — are overbought currently. If economic data
continues to cool during the Fed's cutting cycle, she expects financials and
real estate to continue to slow. For more expert insight and the latest market
action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief. This post was

### [Utilities are almost as big an AI play as tech: Strategist Although the
tech sector (XLK) has suffered in recent weeks, there are plenty of investing
strategies and plays that could help investors find their footing amid
trending volatility. Morningstar Chief US Market Strategist David Sekera joins
Market Domination to give insights into current market trends. Sekera points
out how utilities (XLU) may be an undervalued sector: "On a valuation basis,
[utilities were] pretty much as undervalued according to our valuations as
they had been over the past decade. But that sector is up about 22% year to
date, or even more than that off of those lows from last October. So, at this
point, I think it's time to move to an underweight there." Tying utility
demands back into AI, Sekera finds utilities to be "the big story this year"
as the sector becomes more like a "second derivative of AI. "Of course,
electricity demand will be increasing as more AI comes out there because AI
takes many times more power to run than traditional computing," Sekera says.

### [Big Tech sell-offs, yen trade appear connected: Strategist Stock markets
(^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are off to a bumpy start at the beginning of September
trading, with Big Tech leading the downturn. Charles Schwab chief global
investment strategist Jeffrey Kleintop joins Morning Brief to discuss more on
the market dynamics he sees playing out. Kleintop advises investors to "watch
the [Japanese] yen for clues on the tech trade." He notes that the trade
dynamics of the yen and Big Tech are interconnected among investors, and this
can be observed in the continued tech sell-off and the yen's rise Wednesday
morning. Kleintop also suggests that the unwinding of the yen carry trade may
not be finished and could persist throughout the remainder of 2024. However,
Kleintop says the tech sector unwind "benefits sectors that are undervalued
and under-owned," recommending areas like financials (XLF), energy (XLE), and
materials (XLB) "What we're seeing is the average stock in the S&P 500, look
at the equal-weighted index (^SPXEW), is outperforming the capitalization-
weighted index. So we're seeing strength outside of tech, and that's been our
story about the second half of the year — a broadening of the market," he
tells Yahoo Finance. For more expert insight and the latest market action,

### [Tech may not be market leader through year-end: Strategist The technology
sector (XLK) has been a main driver of markets, but can this trend continue
into a period of market uncertainty (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC)? Crossmark Global
Investments chief market strategist Victoria Fernandez joins Morning Brief to
discuss her outlook on why she believes tech is due for a downturn. Fernandez
acknowledges that tech has been a leading force in markets. However, she
advises investors to trim these positions as markets enter a clear period of
uncertainty and potential volatility (^VIX). She doesn't believe that tech
will continue to lead throughout 2024, stating, "I think you're gonna see some
broadening out in some of those other sectors," highlighting areas like
financials (XLF). For more expert insight and the latest market action, click

### [Trading on technicals in sectors like tech, retail, biotech Second-
quarter earnings season has brought to light different signals about where
each market sector is heading. The retail sector (XRT) and tech sector (XLK)
being among the spaces that saw a mixed bag of results from its top players.
MarketGauge.com chief strategist Michele Schneider joins Market Domination to
give insight into what investors need to know about the current market
environment following earnings, underlining how best to trade on technicals
from each of these industries. Schneider explains the consumer play as
retailers deliver winning or lagging quarterly results amid price-conscious
shoppers, while the retail sector is "very close to a major breakout." Turning
to tech, Schneider details hidden opportunities to watch and how investors
should be "treading water." She names Eli Lilly (LLY) as one other stock that
is "treading water" but in a different manner than tech. Eli Lilly could
potentially see $150 to $200 more in this stock coming up, Schneider says. For

### [Why September historically spells trouble for stocks Stocks have calmed
after a rocky start to August. Tech stocks (XLK) have bounced back, and
markets (^DJI, ^IXIC,^GSPC) seem stable for now. But September, historically
the weakest month for stocks, is approaching. According to Bank of America
(BAC) data, the S&P 500 only rose 44% of the time during September since 1928.
Furthermore, in presidential election years, both September and October have
historically yielded underwhelming average returns of -0.46% and -0.34%,
respectively. On today's Market Minute, Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian
Sozzi discusses these historical market trends, considering what they might
mean for current market conditions. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-

### [Analyst says this company can see near-term AI returns The tech sector is
in focus as leading AI company Nvidia (NVDA) prepares to report earnings on
Wednesday. With expectations around AI growing throughout the tech sector,
investors are eager to see when companies will begin to see returns on their
investments. RBC Capital Markets managing director of software equity research
Rishi Jaluri joins Catalysts to discuss his outlook on the tech sector and AI
expectations. Jaluria believes seeing near-term returns on AI investments will
be "really tricky." However, he argues it's better for these companies to
overinvest rather than underinvest, stating, "This is truly a generational
technological shift," and emphasizing that investors must have patience.
Despite the general caution, Jaluria identifies only one company he believes
will significantly monetize generative AI over the next twelve months:
Microsoft (MSFT). He outlines three key factors necessary for Microsoft to see
AI growth. First, the company needs to show investors acceleration or what AI
could look like within the Azure business without capacity constraints.
Second, other software companies need to develop AI modules, as Microsoft
stands to benefit from this ecosystem growth. Finally, Jaluria emphasizes the
importance of "actual usage and adoption of AI in Microsoft's portfolio
outside of the Azure line." For more expert insight and the latest market
action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts. This post was

Rishi Jaluria joins Catalysts to discuss his reservations about the tech
giant. Jaluria believes Salesforce "should be a major beneficiary of
generative AI" given its business model, operations, and capacity. However, he
notes that the company's AI efforts have been "disappointing" thus far. "I
think they need to show us real innovation around AI," Jaluria told Yahoo

### [Tech sector pressures could be 'good news,' strategist says The tech
sector (XLK) is under pressure as investors await Nvidia's (NVDA) highly
anticipated second quarter results. Concerns are mounting over whether the
semiconductor giant can meet Wall Street's lofty expectations. Principal Asset
Management chief global strategist Seema Shah joins Morning Brief to discuss
the market outlook and what future interest rate cuts could mean for the tech
sector. Shah notes that the second quarter earnings season has shown that the
strong earnings performance, once concentrated within Big Tech, has "started
to broaden out to other sectors." She interprets this as a reflection of
healthy economic growth and "a healthy improvement in the market," adding that
"this is good news." "What we generally want to see, though, for a healthy
equity market, is that you're seeing performance that is spread out across a
number of sectors rather than just being driven... by the Magnificent Seven or
a couple more tech companies," Shah explains. For more expert insight and the

### [How AI investments are shaping the tech sector's future Nvidia's (NVDA)
stock continues to rally ahead of its highly anticipated quarterly earnings
report on August 28th. To discuss the potential impact of the semiconductor
giant's results on the broader tech sector (XLK), Bernstein Internet Equity
Research Analyst Mark Shmulik joins Morning Brief. Shmulik notes that when it
comes to the AI trade, tech giants have made it clear that "the risk of
underinvesting is much higher than the risk of overinvesting." He believes
that "so long as that momentum continues," the entire tech sector stands to
benefit. Regarding tech valuations, Shmulik observes they have cooled and "are
not demanding." However, he emphasizes that companies must "deliver on the
core business ahead of you today" to fund their ongoing AI investments.
Notably, with companies like Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) beginning to see
returns on their AI investments, Shmulik points out that "it's no longer talk
of a theoretical, it's actually showing up in the numbers." When it comes to
investment opportunities in the AI space, Shmulik highlights Meta (META) as
"one of the cleaner names" for those looking to participate in the AI trade.

### [Expect more choppy action from Big Tech stocks: Analyst Equity markets
(^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are rebounding, with the technology sector (XLK) at the
forefront. CFRA Research Senior Equity Analyst Angelo Zino joins Catalysts to
share his outlook on the tech market. Zino notes that while tech has "led the
way" in the market recovery, it remains "the worst performing sector" since
July's market peak. Semiconductors experienced the most severe sell-off but
have since shown the strongest gains and recovery. Looking ahead, Zino
predicts "more choppy action" following this surge, expecting market
volatility to persist for the next 2-3 months and through the election period.
He notes that earnings drive tech stocks and highlights two potential
catalysts: Nvidia's (NVDA) upcoming Blackwell launch and the likely Apple
(AAPL) iPhone 16 release. "Those are the two product launches that we think
could potentially see more upside to consensus estimates," Zino states.
However, he cautions investors not to "expect anything too extreme here, at
least in the immediate near term" from the tech sector. For more expert
insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of

intelligence and robotics are ever-expanding industries, with new research and
innovations coming out every day and major companies competing to get the next
and best new tech. What are the best ways to begin investing into the space?
As part of Yahoo Finance's Robotics Week: Investing in Tomorrow special,
BlackRock US Head of Thematic and Active ETFs Jay Jacobs sits down with Julie
Hyman and Josh Schafer to talk about how investor portfolios can gain exposure
to this next generation of technology. "We're looking to provide exposure
across the value chain of pure-play artificial intelligence companies. That
includes everything from generative AI model developers to artificial
intelligence infrastructure, software and data, as well as artificial
intelligence hardware... think semiconductors," Jacobs tells Yahoo Finance.
"The idea is that as you see more adoption of artificial intelligence, more
use cases that are being put to work... we would expect more adoption of
artificial intelligence to ultimately lift this basket of stocks. That is the
idea behind really trying to be very, very specific about what is the value
chain of artificial intelligence BlackRock manages a variety of exchange-
traded funds, including the iShares Future AI & Tech ETF (ARTY) and iShares
Semiconductor ETF (SOXX). For more expert insight and the latest market

likely some froth in the market, so the recent sell-off was likely healthy for

Barclays Head of US Equity Strategy Venu Krishna wrote that tech leaders are
in "the penalty box" at this time. Krishna joins the Catalyst team in-studio
to talk about the refocus on AI monetization while tech stocks are trading
increasingly higher than their earnings. "If you look at Meta (META), they
posted very good numbers on digital ads. If you look at Amazon (AMZN), they
posted very good numbers on their AWS side. And so if you look at individual
names, they are checking the box," Krishna tells Yahoo Finance. "But clearly
as the focus changes on onto the monetization of AI, from here on you don't
want to pay very high multiples and you want to see actually the monetization
showing up in earnings. And clearly this is a secular trend..." Krishna goes
on to give his year-end forecast for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and communicate how
he sees the rest of the market (^DJI, ^IXIC) reacting to third quarter
earnings forecasts. For more expert insight and the latest market action,

### [The market is 'overreacting' to weak labor report: Economist The major
indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) are bouncing back after a three-day sell-off
triggered by a weaker-than-expected jobs report in July. As investors continue
to be wary of a recession, Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten
Slok joins Catalysts to discuss the market reaction and break down why tech,
in particular, is seeing a massive sell-off. Slok notes that despite the weak
labor report, there's not much other evidence that points to a recession:
"Daily data for how many people fly on airplanes as of last Friday is still
strong. Daily data from OpenTable for how many people go to restaurants is
still strong. Weekly data for retail sales from Redbook is also still strong.
Hotel occupancy rates, the weekly data also still strong." He reiterates
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's emphasis on the totality of the data,
and adds, "the market is overreacting to just one data point." He believes
that the tech sell-off is being driven by two factors. The first is because
"valuations got so stretched and earnings expectations were simply
inconsistent with where valuations were." Therefore, when some of the
Magnificent Seven tech names missed expectations, investors reassessed their
positions. The second boils down to the carry trade unwinding: "You've seen a
reversal of a lot of trades where essentially investors were borrowing in yen.
Remember, in yen, interest rates up until literally two weeks ago were zero.
Now they went up to 25 basis points... dollar-yen has moved from 161 down to
144. That means that if I borrowed in yen, now I need to pay back in yen. If
yen is more expensive, that means that I need to pay back more." Note: Apollo

### [The two tech stocks to buy despite major sector sell-off Nvidia (NVDA)
and Apple (AAPL) are driving the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) into
turmoil amid a major sell-off on Wall Street. D.A. Davidson senior software
analyst Gil Luria joins Morning Brief to discuss the market movement and his
top tech stock picks despite the dip. "There's traders selling because they're
covering their yen carry trade. There's computer algorithmic trading that's
selling because those traders sold. And then there's index fund computers that
are selling because those two sold. What's not happening is somebody didn't
wake up this morning and say Apple, Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) are
worth 5% less than they were on Friday. That's not happening," Luria explains.
He says that fundamental-based investors haven't changed their minds since
Friday, and the prospects for large cap tech companies will continue to do
well. He adds that there are companies out there that will benefit from AI
over the next few years, and that value is not yet reflected in the stock
price. He points to Apple as one of those companies as a buying opportunity,
explaining its AI integration will drive an iPhone upgrade cycle. He also
points to Amazon as another opportunity, noting that its AWS (Amazon Web
Services) segment has more room to grow as it strengthens its AI capabilities.

### [AI capex will be pivotal figure in tech, chip earnings The chip sector
reverses course from gains seen earlier this week. Will this trend continue or
will chip stocks rebound even higher? Harvest Portfolio Management Co-CIO Paul
Meeks joins Catalysts to discuss his outlook on tech amid this earnings
season. Meeks describes the current earnings season as "weird and squirrelly,"
stating he is refraining from buying tech names until the season concludes. He
notes that while some companies are posting strong results, "their stocks go
down the next day," leading him to characterize it as "too difficult of a
market." Regarding tech names, Meeks observes that this earnings season, "The
only thing that was not controversial at all is how much... money they're
going to spend on AI CapEx [capital expenditures]." He believes this "bodes
incredibly well" for companies like Nvidia (NVDA), saying the semiconductor
giant will "have a hold on this market as far as the eye can see." For more
expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full
episode of Catalysts. This post was written by Angel Smith

### [Why this strategist says the tech rotation 'has some legs' The tech
sector (XLK) has been experiencing a market rotation with investors pivoting
into small caps (^RUT). State Street Global Advisors US SPDR Business chief
investment strategist Michael Arone joins Morning Brief to discuss his market
outlook. Arone identifies "a trifecta of positive news" that triggered the
rotation within the tech sector: cooler-than-expected inflation reports,
Federal Reserve Chair Powell hinting toward interest rate cuts, and Powell's
acknowledgment that he didn't see inflation reaching 2%. However, this
earnings season has shown that "good is not good enough" for the Magnificent
Seven tech stocks. Despite top and bottom line beats, any weakness in AI or
cloud businesses has been "a hindrance to the stock," suggesting that the
rotation "has some legs." Amid this shift, Arone highlights financials as an
attractive sector, noting increased M&A activity and improving earnings. Arone
also points to the insurance industry, saying it's "an area where they have
pricing power." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click
