### [AI capex will be pivotal figure in tech, chip earnings The chip sector
reverses course from gains seen earlier this week. Will this trend continue or
will chip stocks rebound even higher? Harvest Portfolio Management Co-CIO Paul
Meeks joins Catalysts to discuss his outlook on tech amid this earnings
season. Meeks describes the current earnings season as "weird and squirrelly,"
stating he is refraining from buying tech names until the season concludes. He
notes that while some companies are posting strong results, "their stocks go
down the next day," leading him to characterize it as "too difficult of a
market." Regarding tech names, Meeks observes that this earnings season, "The
only thing that was not controversial at all is how much... money they're
going to spend on AI CapEx [capital expenditures]." He believes this "bodes
incredibly well" for companies like Nvidia (NVDA), saying the semiconductor
giant will "have a hold on this market as far as the eye can see." For more

### [Market is 'pretty consistent' with Fed's rate cut uncertainty Federal
Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is speaking at the European Central Bank (ECB)
Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal on Tuesday, stating the US Fed
has "made quite a bit of progress" on tamping inflation down to its 2% target.
The Morning Brief welcomes on Marketgauge.com chief strategist Michele
Schneider, who believes the market (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) is moving in-line with
Powell's comments and the Fed's overall interest rate policy. "Essentially
there's a there's a double-edged sword when it comes to these yields. You want
the yields not to get too soft in essence because, to date, we've actually had
the S&P 500 outperform the long bonds," Schneider says on Treasury yields
(^TYX, ^TNX, ^FVX). "And the junk bonds relationship to the long bonds is also
important because they have really been more on a risk on. So even though the
yields pinch and certainly pinch areas that are very interest rate
sensitive... It's also really giving confidence." Schneider also comments on
Nvidia (NVDA) in the semiconductor industry and various commodities. For more

### [Wall Street Favorites: 3 ETFs With Strong Buy Ratings for June 2024 In an
era of market crashes and booms, strong buy ETFs are now a go-to option for
many investors. Exchange-traded funds offer a compelling case to combat market
risks by investing in a broad range of stocks instead of an individual asset.
This, in turn, provides diversification, liquidity and cost-efficiency for
risk-averse investors. In recent years, we’ve witnessed substantial growth in
the ETF market. In 2023, the ETF industry managed $11 trillion in assets
globally with a five-year compound ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-

individuals seeking a more hands-off approach to investing. The rate of
returns for many ETFs also exceeds the returns of major stock market indices
such as the S&P 500. The risk of loss is also far less than that of individual
