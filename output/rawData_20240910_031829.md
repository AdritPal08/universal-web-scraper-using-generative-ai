### [Investors shouldn't 'reach too far for risk': Strategist While contending
with September's seasonal volatility, stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) slide
further in Friday's session in response to the August jobs data released this
morning. While nonfarm payroll jobs growth came below economist expectations,
the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2%. All of these factors are colliding
with losses seen in the AI chip trade as semiconductor manufacturers Nvidia
(NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) failed to wow Wall Street with their earnings
beats. John Hancock Investment Management co-chief investment strategist Emily
Roland sits down with the Market Domination team to discuss which sectors
investors can find more quality trades in while avoiding risk. "The poster
child for quality is mega-cap tech. We like that, but we do have a valuation
issue there with the tech sector bumping up towards 30-times forward
earnings," Roland explains. "So we want to look at other areas of the market
quality at a reasonable price, if you will. So looking at sectors like
healthcare, which are trading at a 10% discount to the broad market..." Roland
weighs in on Big Tech stocks, the AI trade, and the bond market (^TYX, ^TNX,
^FVX) ahead of the Federal Reserve's plans to cut interest rates. For more

### [It's 'premature' to think soft landing is secured: Strategist Investors
are moving to defensive corners of the market (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) on Thursday
as fresh data sparked some concerns of too much weakness in the labor market.
SoFi head of investment strategy Liz Young Thomas joins Morning Brief to
discuss the market's reaction to the data and how investors can best position
their portfolios as the Federal Reserve begins its rate-easing cycle. Thomas
notes that "equities are still cheering for the beginning of this rate-cutting
cycle" as the Fed eyes a soft landing. She explains that easing rates will
likely benefit cyclical areas of the market, like small caps (^RUT),
financials (XLF), real estate (XLRE), and industrials (XLI). However, she
warns that "it would be premature to assume that we have secured a soft
landing." Investors should still have some exposure to areas of the market
that benefit from a steepening yield curve. Thomas points to gold (GC=F) as a
good option as the global currency is experiencing volatility. As all eyes are
on Friday's August jobs report, Thomas believes that if the data comes in
cooler than expected, the market will react negatively and will likely
experience a sell-off of mega-cap names. She adds that utilities are "not just
a purely defensive play" at this stage, as they are a beneficiary of the AI
trade. In addition, she explains that consumer staples (XLP) — another
traditional defensive play — are overbought currently. If economic data
continues to cool during the Fed's cutting cycle, she expects financials and
real estate to continue to slow. For more expert insight and the latest market

### [Utilities are almost as big an AI play as tech: Strategist Although the
tech sector (XLK) has suffered in recent weeks, there are plenty of investing
strategies and plays that could help investors find their footing amid
trending volatility. Morningstar Chief US Market Strategist David Sekera joins
Market Domination to give insights into current market trends. Sekera points
out how utilities (XLU) may be an undervalued sector: "On a valuation basis,
[utilities were] pretty much as undervalued according to our valuations as
they had been over the past decade. But that sector is up about 22% year to
date, or even more than that off of those lows from last October. So, at this
point, I think it's time to move to an underweight there." Tying utility
demands back into AI, Sekera finds utilities to be "the big story this year"
as the sector becomes more like a "second derivative of AI. "Of course,
electricity demand will be increasing as more AI comes out there because AI
takes many times more power to run than traditional computing," Sekera says.

### [Big Tech sell-offs, yen trade appear connected: Strategist Stock markets
(^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are off to a bumpy start at the beginning of September
trading, with Big Tech leading the downturn. Charles Schwab chief global
investment strategist Jeffrey Kleintop joins Morning Brief to discuss more on
the market dynamics he sees playing out. Kleintop advises investors to "watch
the [Japanese] yen for clues on the tech trade." He notes that the trade
dynamics of the yen and Big Tech are interconnected among investors, and this
can be observed in the continued tech sell-off and the yen's rise Wednesday
morning. Kleintop also suggests that the unwinding of the yen carry trade may
not be finished and could persist throughout the remainder of 2024. However,
Kleintop says the tech sector unwind "benefits sectors that are undervalued
and under-owned," recommending areas like financials (XLF), energy (XLE), and
materials (XLB) "What we're seeing is the average stock in the S&P 500, look
at the equal-weighted index (^SPXEW), is outperforming the capitalization-
weighted index. So we're seeing strength outside of tech, and that's been our
story about the second half of the year — a broadening of the market," he
tells Yahoo Finance. For more expert insight and the latest market action,

quarter earnings season has brought to light different signals about where
each market sector is heading. The retail sector (XRT) and tech sector (XLK)
being among the spaces that saw a mixed bag of results from its top players.
MarketGauge.com chief strategist Michele Schneider joins Market Domination to
give insight into what investors need to know about the current market
environment following earnings, underlining how best to trade on technicals
from each of these industries. Schneider explains the consumer play as
retailers deliver winning or lagging quarterly results amid price-conscious
shoppers, while the retail sector is "very close to a major breakout." Turning
to tech, Schneider details hidden opportunities to watch and how investors
should be "treading water." She names Eli Lilly (LLY) as one other stock that
is "treading water" but in a different manner than tech. Eli Lilly could
potentially see $150 to $200 more in this stock coming up, Schneider says. For

after a rocky start to August. Tech stocks (XLK) have bounced back, and
markets (^DJI, ^IXIC,^GSPC) seem stable for now. But September, historically
the weakest month for stocks, is approaching. According to Bank of America
(BAC) data, the S&P 500 only rose 44% of the time during September since 1928.
Furthermore, in presidential election years, both September and October have
historically yielded underwhelming average returns of -0.46% and -0.34%,
respectively. On today's Market Minute, Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian
Sozzi discusses these historical market trends, considering what they might

### [Analyst says this company can see near-term AI returns The tech sector is
in focus as leading AI company Nvidia (NVDA) prepares to report earnings on
Wednesday. With expectations around AI growing throughout the tech sector,
investors are eager to see when companies will begin to see returns on their
investments. RBC Capital Markets managing director of software equity research
Rishi Jaluri joins Catalysts to discuss his outlook on the tech sector and AI
expectations. Jaluria believes seeing near-term returns on AI investments will
be "really tricky." However, he argues it's better for these companies to
overinvest rather than underinvest, stating, "This is truly a generational
technological shift," and emphasizing that investors must have patience.
Despite the general caution, Jaluria identifies only one company he believes
will significantly monetize generative AI over the next twelve months:
Microsoft (MSFT). He outlines three key factors necessary for Microsoft to see
AI growth. First, the company needs to show investors acceleration or what AI
could look like within the Azure business without capacity constraints.
Second, other software companies need to develop AI modules, as Microsoft
stands to benefit from this ecosystem growth. Finally, Jaluria emphasizes the
importance of "actual usage and adoption of AI in Microsoft's portfolio
outside of the Azure line." For more expert insight and the latest market
action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts. This post was

Rishi Jaluria joins Catalysts to discuss his reservations about the tech
giant. Jaluria believes Salesforce "should be a major beneficiary of
generative AI" given its business model, operations, and capacity. However, he
notes that the company's AI efforts have been "disappointing" thus far. "I
think they need to show us real innovation around AI," Jaluria told Yahoo

### [Tech sector pressures could be 'good news,' strategist says The tech
sector (XLK) is under pressure as investors await Nvidia's (NVDA) highly
anticipated second quarter results. Concerns are mounting over whether the
semiconductor giant can meet Wall Street's lofty expectations. Principal Asset
Management chief global strategist Seema Shah joins Morning Brief to discuss
the market outlook and what future interest rate cuts could mean for the tech
sector. Shah notes that the second quarter earnings season has shown that the
strong earnings performance, once concentrated within Big Tech, has "started
to broaden out to other sectors." She interprets this as a reflection of
healthy economic growth and "a healthy improvement in the market," adding that
"this is good news." "What we generally want to see, though, for a healthy
equity market, is that you're seeing performance that is spread out across a
number of sectors rather than just being driven... by the Magnificent Seven or
a couple more tech companies," Shah explains. For more expert insight and the

### [Dow record, tech drags S&P 500, small caps: Market Takeaways The Dow
Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed at a record high on Monday, while the
tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) indexes closed in
negative territory. Despite Big Tech's recovery from wide sell-offs at the
beginning of August, there still seems to be some anxieties ahead of Nvidia's
(NVDA) second quarter earnings results due out Wednesday, August 28. Small cap
stocks (^RUT) are of note as current earnings estimates are lagging behind the
S&P 500, according to data from an Empirical Research Partners analysis,
leaving them under valued as more earnings could drive them up. Yahoo Finance
markets reporter Josh Schafer joins Market Domination Overtime to break down
the top market trends from the August 26 trading day. For more expert insight

### [How AI investments are shaping the tech sector's future Nvidia's (NVDA)
stock continues to rally ahead of its highly anticipated quarterly earnings
report on August 28th. To discuss the potential impact of the semiconductor
giant's results on the broader tech sector (XLK), Bernstein Internet Equity
Research Analyst Mark Shmulik joins Morning Brief. Shmulik notes that when it
comes to the AI trade, tech giants have made it clear that "the risk of
underinvesting is much higher than the risk of overinvesting." He believes
that "so long as that momentum continues," the entire tech sector stands to
benefit. Regarding tech valuations, Shmulik observes they have cooled and "are
not demanding." However, he emphasizes that companies must "deliver on the
core business ahead of you today" to fund their ongoing AI investments.
Notably, with companies like Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) beginning to see
returns on their AI investments, Shmulik points out that "it's no longer talk
of a theoretical, it's actually showing up in the numbers." When it comes to
investment opportunities in the AI space, Shmulik highlights Meta (META) as
"one of the cleaner names" for those looking to participate in the AI trade.

### [Expect more choppy action from Big Tech stocks: Analyst Equity markets
(^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are rebounding, with the technology sector (XLK) at the
forefront. CFRA Research Senior Equity Analyst Angelo Zino joins Catalysts to
share his outlook on the tech market. Zino notes that while tech has "led the
way" in the market recovery, it remains "the worst performing sector" since
July's market peak. Semiconductors experienced the most severe sell-off but
have since shown the strongest gains and recovery. Looking ahead, Zino
predicts "more choppy action" following this surge, expecting market
volatility to persist for the next 2-3 months and through the election period.
He notes that earnings drive tech stocks and highlights two potential
catalysts: Nvidia's (NVDA) upcoming Blackwell launch and the likely Apple
(AAPL) iPhone 16 release. "Those are the two product launches that we think
could potentially see more upside to consensus estimates," Zino states.
However, he cautions investors not to "expect anything too extreme here, at
least in the immediate near term" from the tech sector. For more expert
insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of

### [Tech stocks lead Nasdaq, S&P 500 rebound: A break down The Nasdaq
Composite (^IXIC) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) indexes are rebounding from downward
pressures that hit tech stocks (XLK) at the beginning of August. Now, Big Tech
names, particularly Nvidia (NVDA), are seeing major gains. Why are tech stocks
seeing this rebound and is it time to buy back into the sector? Yahoo Finance
markets reporter Josh Schafer joins Morning Brief to break down tech's
reversal from last week's sell-off and how the sector is leading the market
rally on Friday morning. For more expert insight and the latest market action,

### [Market moves, tech rally, Harris's economic policy: 3 Things Stock
futures (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are dipping into negative territory ahead of

sales and lower-than-expected initial jobless claims. The tech sector (XLK) is
leading market rallies in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite as Big Tech names
rebound from recent sell-offs. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is up over 17% in the
last five trading days. Vice President Kamala Harris will outline her economic
policy agenda at a speech in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Friday, focusing on
