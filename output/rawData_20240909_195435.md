### [AI capex will be pivotal figure in tech, chip earnings The chip sector
reverses course from gains seen earlier this week. Will this trend continue or
will chip stocks rebound even higher? Harvest Portfolio Management Co-CIO Paul
Meeks joins Catalysts to discuss his outlook on tech amid this earnings
season. Meeks describes the current earnings season as "weird and squirrelly,"
stating he is refraining from buying tech names until the season concludes. He
notes that while some companies are posting strong results, "their stocks go
down the next day," leading him to characterize it as "too difficult of a
market." Regarding tech names, Meeks observes that this earnings season, "The
only thing that was not controversial at all is how much... money they're
going to spend on AI CapEx [capital expenditures]." He believes this "bodes
incredibly well" for companies like Nvidia (NVDA), saying the semiconductor
giant will "have a hold on this market as far as the eye can see." For more
expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full
episode of Catalysts. This post was written by Angel Smith

### [Market is 'pretty consistent' with Fed's rate cut uncertainty Federal
Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is speaking at the European Central Bank (ECB)
Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal on Tuesday, stating the US Fed
has "made quite a bit of progress" on tamping inflation down to its 2% target.
The Morning Brief welcomes on Marketgauge.com chief strategist Michele
Schneider, who believes the market (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) is moving in-line with
Powell's comments and the Fed's overall interest rate policy. "Essentially
there's a there's a double-edged sword when it comes to these yields. You want
the yields not to get too soft in essence because, to date, we've actually had
the S&P 500 outperform the long bonds," Schneider says on Treasury yields
(^TYX, ^TNX, ^FVX). "And the junk bonds relationship to the long bonds is also
important because they have really been more on a risk on. So even though the
yields pinch and certainly pinch areas that are very interest rate
sensitive... It's also really giving confidence." Schneider also comments on
Nvidia (NVDA) in the semiconductor industry and various commodities. For more
expert insight and the latest market action, click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to watch

### [3 ETFs to Buy for Nvidia Stock Dominance Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has grown
to become quite a dominant holding in a number of tech-focused exchange-traded
funds (ETFs) amid its glorious ascent. Though NVDA stock is no longer the
world’s largest company after its latest correction, bringing the market cap
to $3 trillion flat, I still think it’s a bad idea to think the firm can’t
continue its growth just because of its behemoth size. Indeed, a firm’s sheer
size alone doesn’t seem to act as a limitation on growth, especially for
